<h1> ABOUT ME :</h1>
<p>Seven billion people are on this Earth, and everybody is different from the rest of others. There is nothing without purpose in this world. Everything has some purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. Thus, writing about myself, I’m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life. I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking and honest.
</p>

<h2>
My Family and My Childhood -
</h2>

<p>
 I am Traya Jawahar. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a engineer.My mother is a doctor. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.
</p>

<p>I have a younger sister. Being the eldest I am the most liable from my sister. I am wanted to guide and take care of my other sister. We  are in the same school. Coding is my passion. I have a strong interest in games, space and robotics. I love to code games and robots which makes me happy. At my pre-childhood, I used to listen to stories from my cousin brother about robots, and this has a long-lasting effect on me.
</p>

<h2>
My Education-
</h2>

<p>
I am studying at the best school in my city. I am presently in class 10th. I feel happy to be a part of this great school with the good friends, helpful and loving teacher and sound school administration. I have extraordinary skills in some subjects whereas I am very weak in the few.
</p>

<h2>My Strengths-</h2>
<p>In compare to studies, I am good at sports. so I am the captain of my class kho-kho team. I am the best kho-kho player at my school. Besides this, I love cricket..
</p>

    <p>The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there; it’s in you.”
    </p>

<p>Along with this, I fond of reading a few children magazines in which different motivational stories are there. They taught me a high moral lesson. I am a very confident person and know how to talk. I always try to speak to every person according to his requirement so I understand people.
</p>

    <h2>My Weaknesses-</h2>
    <p>As every person have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like. While playing time, I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.
 </p>
 <h2>My Ambitions in Life-</h2>
 <p>Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man. No man can do anything in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.
</p>
<p>Without good career planning, right from the start, one can’t be on the right track. One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals.
</p>
<p>I want to become an engineer and I will seat for the competitive entrance exam for admission to reputed engineering college. I shall try to be a good and honest student. Then I shall be a qualified engineer. I will do all that to be a good engineer and will be sincere to it.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion-</h2>
<p>These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to follow my passion and make my family and friends proud.
